      Berkatlah Yang DiPertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan is the state anthem of Negeri Sembilan. It was composed by Andrew Caldecott (1884â€“1951) with lyrics by Tunku Zakaria Mambang, and it was used by Tuanku Muhammad, who was the ruler at that time.

The anthem had went under a revitalization project by the efforts of the second son of the current Yang DiPertuan Besar, Tunku Zain Al-'Abidin ibni Tuanku Muhriz.[1] The rearranged composition, recorded with the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra and choir groups from several schools across the state,[1] was first presented to the public on the installation ceremonies of Tuanku Muhriz and his wife Tuanku Aishah Rohani in early 2009, and it was officially launched on 27 October 2010.[2]

Lyrics
Malay
Berkatlah Yang Dipertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan
Kurniai sihat dan makmur
Kasihi rakyat lanjutkan umur
Akan berkati sekalian yang setia
Musuhnya habis binasa
Berkatlah Yang Dipertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan.
Rough English translation
Blessed are you, great ruler of Negeri Sembilan
May you be healthy and live long
Love your citizens, live long
Will readily pray for you
All his enemies will be completely destroyed
Blessed are you, great ruler of Negeri Sembilan.

The line "Musuhnya habis binasa" is also adapted as a motto for the state's football team, Negeri Sembilan FA.
